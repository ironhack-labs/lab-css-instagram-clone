  <p>Instagram is a <span>fast, beautiful</span> and <span>fun</span> way to share your life with friends and family.</p>

  <p>Take a picture or video, choose a filter to transform its look and feel, then post to Instagram &mdash; it's that easy. You can even share to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and more. It's a new way to see the world.</p>

  <p>Oh yeah, did we mention it's free?</p>
