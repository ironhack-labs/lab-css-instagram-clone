     <h3>Capture and Share the World's Moments</h3>

      <p>Instagram is a fast, beautiful and fun way to share your life with 
          friends and family.
    </p>

      <p>Take a picture or video, choose a filter to transform its look
    and feel, then post to Instagram &mdash; it's that easy. You can
    even share to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and more. It's a
    new way to see the world.
    </p>

      <p>Oh yeah, did we mention it's free?
