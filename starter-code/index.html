          Instagram is a <span class = "bold">fast, beautiful</span> and <span class = "bold">fun</span> way to share your life with friends and family. <br><br>
          Take a picture or video, choose a filter to transform its look and feel, then post to Instagram &mdash; it's that easy. You can even share to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and more. It's a new way to see the world.<br><br>
          Oh yeah, did we mention it's free?
