      <h3>Capture and Share<br> the World's Moments</h3>
    <p>Instagram is a <span>fast, beautiful</span> and <span>fun</span> way to share your life<br> with friends and family.<br><br>

    Take a picture or video, choose a filter to transform its look<br> and feel, then post to Instagram &mdash; it's that easy. You can<br> even share to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and more. It's a<br> new way to see the world.<br><br>

    Oh yeah, did we mention it's free?<br></p>
