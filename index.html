          <h1>Instagram Capture and Share the World's Moments</h1>
          <p>
            Instagram is a <strong> fast, beautiful </strong> and
              <strong> fun </strong> way to share your life with friends and family.
            <br />
            Take a picture or video, choose a filter to transform its look and
            feel, then post to Instagram &mdash; it's that easy. You can even
            share to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and more. It's a new way to see
            the world. <br />
            Oh yeah, did we mention it's  free?
