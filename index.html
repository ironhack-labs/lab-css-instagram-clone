            <p>
              Instagram is a fast, beautiful and fun way to share your life with
              friends and family. Take a picture or video, choose a filter to
              transform its look and feel, then post to Instagram &mdash; it's that
              easy. You can even share to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and more. It's a
              new way to see the world. <br />
              Oh yeah, did we mention it's free?
