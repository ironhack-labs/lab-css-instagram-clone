  <h1>Capture and Share the World's Moments</h1>

  Instagram is a <spam class="bold">fast, beautiful</spam> and <spam class="bold">fun</spam> way to share your life with friends and family.<br>
  <br>
  Take a picture or video, choose a filter to transform its look and feel, then post to Instagram &mdash; it's that easy. You can even share to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and more. It's a new way to see the world.<br>
 <br>
  Oh yeah, did we mention it's free?
