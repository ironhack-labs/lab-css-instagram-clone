            <h3>Capture and Share <br>the World's Moments</h3>
            <p>Instagram is a fast, beautiful and fun way to share your life with friends and family. Take a picture or video, choose a filter to transform its look and feel, then post to Instagram; it's that easy. You can even share to Facebook, Twitter,
                Tumblr and more. It's a new way to see the world. Oh yeah, did we mention it's free? </p>
