# CSS | Instagram Clone

## Introduction

One of the best ways to sharpen your CSS skills is to try to recreate an existing style and layout, so take a look at the deliverable below, work with a partner, and build your own version of Instagram.com.  Don't worry if you can't get it to look _exactly_ as you see but try your best to get as close as possible.

There's a bit of starter code, so you can jump right into it.

## Exercise

## Requirements

- [Fork this repo](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)
- Clone this repo into your `~/code/labs`
- Use [display](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display), [clear](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clear), and [floats](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/float) to position elements on the page
- Look up in [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/) and use CSS properties and values that may not have been covered in class, for example:
  - `background: url("YOUR-LINK.COM")`
  - `list-style`
  - `text-decoration`
  - `text-transform`
- Use a single external CSS stylesheet to style all pages
- Use the images provided to construct the appropriate elements on the page:
  - the iPhone
  - App Store and Google Play buttons
  - Instagram Logo
  - Login button

## Submission

- Upon completion, run the following commands

  ```
  git add .
  git commit -m "done"
  git push origin master
  ```

- Navigate to your repo and [create a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)


## Starter code

The starter-code contains all the files, images, and text content needed to create the page. The text is in the `index.html`, and the color palette is in `main.css`
