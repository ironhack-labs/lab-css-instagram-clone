# LAB | CSS Instagram Clone

## Introduction

One of the best ways to sharpen your CSS skills is to try to recreate an existing style and layout, so take a look at the deliverable below, work with a partner, and build your own version of Instagram.com. Don't worry if you can't get it to look _exactly_ as you see but try your best to get as close as possible.

There's a bit of starter code, so you can jump right into it.

## Requirements

- Fork this repo
- Clone this repo

* Use one of the CSS layout techniques to position elements on the page ([display](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display), [float](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/float), [flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox), or [grids](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Grids))
* Look up in [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/) and use CSS properties and values that may not have been covered in class, for example:
  - `background: url("YOUR-LINK.COM")`
  - `list-style`
  - `text-decoration`
  - `text-transform`
* Use a single external CSS stylesheet to style all pages
* Use the images provided to construct the appropriate elements on the page:
  - the iPhone
  - App Store and Google Play buttons
  - Instagram Logo
  - Login button

## Submission

Upon completion, run the following commands:

```
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "done"
$ git push origin master
```

Create Pull Request so your TAs can check up your work.

## Instructions
