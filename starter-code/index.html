    <h1><b>Capture and Share the World's Moments</b></h1>
      <p>Instagram is a <b>fast, beautiful</b> and <b>fun</b> way to share your life with friends and family.
         Take a picture or video, choose a filter to transform its look and feel, then post to Instagram &mdash; it's that easy. You can even share to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and more. It's a new way to see the world.
         Oh yeah, did we mention it's free?
