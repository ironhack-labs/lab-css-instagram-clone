        <p class="text">Instagram is a fast, beautiful and fun way to share your life with
          friends and family. Take a picture or video, choose a filter to transform its look and feel, then post to Instagram
          &mdash; it's that easy. You can even share to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and more. It's a new way to see the world.
          Oh yeah, did we mention it's free?</p>
